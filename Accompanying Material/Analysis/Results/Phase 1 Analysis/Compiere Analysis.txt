Findings - Compiere

Initially the ERP tool Compiere appeared to have a huge number of vulnerabilities within it's 339 third-party dependencies. Upon further investigation however, it became apparent that there was alot of duplication of reported vulnerabilities. The issue here is inter-dependent third-party dependencies.

Basically, Compiere includes JBoss as one of it's dependencies. A considerable number of the other dependencies in turn have a dependency on JBoss. So any single vulnerability in JBoss was highlighted multiple times.

When we examine unique vulnerabilities only, we are left with the following list:
