Need a better naming convention for the reports; so I can easily correlate the output from the Dependency tool, with the appropriate output from my analysis tool. Might need to use the timestamped directory from the dependency check tool to correlate this information. It's becoming too unwieldly to tell which analysis corresponds with which.

- Resolved this by ensuring all analysis are numbered "1stAnalysis", "2ndAnalysis", etc. I can easily tell the date that these were generated by looking at the report directories themselves (since these are timestamped)
