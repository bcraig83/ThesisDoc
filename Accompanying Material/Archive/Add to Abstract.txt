This dissertation examines the effects of using these third party libraries. A large range of open source projects are examined and then compared against their third party dependencies. This is to determine whether more security vulnerabilities are exposed via third-party dependencies, or by the source code that uses those dependencies. 

This is an important area of research, as it could help guide future policy in dealing with third-party library usage. From an enterprise perspective, it is important to determine how best to ensure delivery of secure applications to customers. From a business perspective, it is important to keep delivery costs down, while preserving security and without compromising customer integrity. Usage of third-party libraries helps keep costs down, but must be compared to the possibility of introducing potential vulnerabilities. 

Software development companies must decide which provides the better investment; usage of third-party libraries that may be cost-effective but vulnerable, or training staff to write more secure code. This dissertation attempts to find out if more attention is needed in educating developers to write more secure code or highlighting the potential pitfalls in using common third-party libraries.
